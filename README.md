# ParikshaCal 📅

*A public calendar for exams & events — making scheduling smarter and conflict-free.*

---

## 🌍 Overview

In India, students often face **exam date clashes** across universities, boards, and recruitment bodies. Exam authorities also struggle to find **available centres**, since schools and colleges double as venues for multiple examinations and events.

**ParikshaCal** solves this problem by providing a **publicly accessible, open calendar** of exams and events. Organisers, students, and decision-makers can quickly see upcoming schedules and avoid conflicts.

---

## 🎯 Problem We Solve

* **Student Dilemma** → One student, two exams on the same day.
* **Centre Availability** → Government schools/colleges overbooked.
* **Lack of Transparency** → No centralised view for organisers to plan dates.

---

## ✅ Features

* 📌 **Calendar View** → Month & week layouts with color-coded events.
* 🎨 **Importance Levels** → National exams, state exams, and local events shown distinctly.
* 🏷 **Categories** → Secondary school, senior secondary, graduates, recruitment, etc.
* 🌐 **Scope Tags** → All-India, State-level, or local events.
* 💻 **Mode Labels** → Online vs Offline exams.
* 🔗 **Official Sources** → Each exam/event links back to its verified notice.
* ⚡ **Future-ready** → Extendable to rallies, festivals, or any public event affecting scheduling.
